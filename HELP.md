## how to join a group
simply write "join *role name*" and you will join that role

## but which roles can I join

In short there are some role that you can't simply join but these ones are open 

roles
-----
- helfer 
- netTest
- nofreegames

So if you are interested in helping out in general small things than this is the channel for you.
For instance things like double checking list and see if we forget about important things or more. Seriously these things are important and we just start out with organization.  
- "helfer"

Another more specific role is Network tester, just like modern games we plan to do a network test. So if you have a laptop with wifi and wanna help out please join the role.
- "netTest" 

Is your steam libary way to big and you don't want anymore of that free stuff. Reduce the amount of notifications with by opting-out of the free games channle
- "nofreegames" 

That's currently all for the freely joinable roles, we'll keep you up to date in the discord if anything changes.

If you want to help us with any other Openings hit up @Akoyaki/Max and he'll get you stared with everything

## you have enough of the role

simply write "leave *role name*" and if everything goes acording to plan you have gotten rid of that role.
