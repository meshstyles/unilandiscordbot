# VOTES
If your a mod you can initalize votes. These votes are not bound to a specific channel but please stick to them if it doesn't specifically belong to a conversation

## HOW TO
Use this pattern
"!vote ?q Question text here -Response number one -Response number two -Response number three -Response number four"
Currently we only support from two to four possible resonses to a vote and do not garantee the reaction order.
