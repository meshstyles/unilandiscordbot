# Uni Lan Discord Bot

## need help with the bot?
[Here](HELP.md) is the help page.
[Hier](HILFE.md) ist die Hilfe Seite.

## reasons
Maintaing a Discord can get boring.
Some roles just exist to hide some clutter so obviously you don't want to assign and remove these roles by yourself. 
Therefore a bot can come in handy.
Sure there are other ways to solve this like Dyno bot but hey if you do it yourself you can make a pretty cool custom solution and learn some node by doing so.

## not reinventing the wheel
I allready did a few things before so I just took asuka bot and modified that bot a fair bit.
Sure there is an argument to be made to just use a diffrent branch in that git but I kinda prefer diffrent repos for diffrent things and this one is just for the specific purpose of managing this specific discord.

## why use an online git?
Well for one I want to be able to share the code between devices and maybe intoduce interested people from the event Server to programm with me.
Also I can put a helpsite in this repo and collect some experiance with Github pages
